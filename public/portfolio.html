      <h3>What I love to do</h3>
      <h4 class="quotes">"The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience." -Eleanor Roosevelt</h4>
      <p>I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, I love everything that     our beautiful state of Washington has to offer. So when it comes to my      hobbies you could easily guess that most of them have to do with outdoor
        activites. Some of my favorite activites include hiking, fishing, riding
        dirt bikes, playing with my daughter at the park, and more. In my own
        opinion, hiking up to a waterfall or to a beautiful lake are the best
        hikes, and the most memorable. I'm always up to trying something new and
        creating a new experience, and I feel that's important to teach my
        daughter the same! Though when I'm not outside, I am plugged away on ym computer coding away learning something new! What is more thriling than being able to create something, anything, so incredible out of nothing? Being able to impact the world and the people around me with my own ideas is the enjoyment and satisfaction that I'm excited to work for in the years to come.  </p>
