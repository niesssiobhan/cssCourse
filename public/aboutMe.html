    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, I love everything that our
      beautiful state of Washington has to offer. So when it comes to my hobbies
      you could easily guess that most of them have to do with outdoor
      activites. Some of my favorite activites include hiking, fishing, riding
      dirt bikes, playing with my daughter at the park, and more. In my own
      opinion, hiking up to a waterfall or to a beautiful lake are the best
      hikes,and the most memorable. I'm always up to trying something new and
      creating a new experience, and I feel that's important to teach my
      daughter the same!
